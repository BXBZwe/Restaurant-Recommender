# Restaurant Recommender

## Part I: User-based Nearest Neighbor Recommendation Algorithm and Evaluation

- Implemented the User-based Nearest Neighbor algorithm using Cosine Similarity.
- Predicted ratings for unseen books in 'rating_testset.csv' with k = 7.
- Displayed the top 5 not-yet-visited restaurants for each user based on similarity results.

## Part II: Collaborative-Based Filtering Algorithm and Evaluation

- Developed a collaborative-based recommendation approach.
- Stored user profiles, similarity matrix, and recommended restaurants.
- Calculated RMSE, Precision, and Recall for all unseen items.

### Data Source

- Training Data: 'rating_trainset.csv'
- Test Data: 'rating_testset.csv'

### Results

Results are stored in corresponding CSV files for reference.
